        <h2> Why Craven for President</h2>
        <p>Craven should be president because he is really awesome. He tells a lot of jokes in class, and he helps                   students who have no idea what they are doing. Craven should be president because he likes robotics, video                 game development, web development, project management, software security, reliability and distributed                     systems. Those are some skills you need to run a country most likely. He also shows strong interest in the                weather and flying machines. Area 51 could surely use his help identifying some unidentified flying objects.              Basically, vote for Craven for president because why not? Also, Roll Storm! </p>
